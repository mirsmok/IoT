This develop board integrated ESP8266 and 18650 battery. A standard 3000mAH 18650 battery could run it 17 hours.
What is it?
You can call it "WiFi Battery". I added a 18650 battery to ESP8266 make ESP8266 more easy to develop projects.
Why did you make it?
When you do some ESP8266 projects you must hate to add a power bank to provide the power. This tiny board could solve such problems. A 3000mAH 18650 battery could make ESP8266 run 17 hours or more.
What makes it special?

· 18650 charging system integrated.
· indicate LED inside(Green means full& Red means charging)
· Charging and working could be at the same time.
· 1 Switch could control the power.
· 1 SMT connector could be used to sleep mode
